# So you wanna pick a programming language now?

## Before we do this

You should have a feel for what you wanna do with programming as a skill or at least what you wanna try (e.g. specific programmming language, technology, area of expertise).

## Different Languages, Different Use Cases

Each programming language can be more or less suitable for one's use case depending on what they generally enable one to do and what eco system you can expect around this language.

> Note:
>
> Newer languages might come with benefits like increased speeds or ease of use but often lack the ecosystem more established languages have.
>
> You have to weigh pros and cons against each other when choosing a programming language to learn/make a program in.
