# History of programming

We had had a loooong way to go until we ended up where we are today. Let me take you on a little journey...

## Humble beginnings of programming

### Textiles and Punch Cards

The first programs weren't written on a screen. Heck they weren't even written at all!

They were punched into cards and they didn't display a shiny UI. They were used to automate machines involved in the weaving process.

## Low Level Predecessor Languages

### Can I have your compiler?

> It was common for languages back then to write their compiler on an existing compiler platform/programming language.
>
> The first more known instance of this was the C programming language:

To keep it short: C used Assembly to write it's compiler.

> A compiler is a program that is used to execute code by translating the code you write into a language computers can understand _binary code_.

> An interpreter is also a program used to execute code but instead of translating the whole programm at once like the compiler does, it only translates the pieces that are currently needed.

> Code is the thing that you write to create a program so a computer can execute it with the help of the compiler.

**Now you may ask: But how can it be that there's C code when I look up the source code of the C compiler?**

Let's see what happened there:

So the base of the C compiler is Assembly code which in turn is translated into binary code.

_How can the compiler be written in C then? - It isn't really written in C._

Under the hood it's all Assembly. They just used Assembly to code the necessary parts of the language compiler and could then use the C programming language itself to extend its functionality.

If you wanna have a specific history from a compiler borrowing progression:

Binary > Assembly > C (1973, Dennis Ritchie) > C++ (1983, Bjarne Stroustrup) > Java (1995, Sun Microsystems) > Kotlin (2011, JetBrains)

## The rise of popularity in the 90s

Following the languages that build on Assembler and lower level languages, high level languages like Java and Python increased the popularity of software development.

While low level languages provided high memory control, high level languages provided abstractions that enabled more rapid development as well as adressed other use cases where memory allocation isn't the main focus.

The web language trinity of HTML, CSS and JavaScript was also born during this time allowing the evolving internet to grow.

All of this was possible because of multiple trends during that time:

<ul>
    <li>
    The rise of personal computers
    </li>
    <li>
    The attractive tech job market during that time
    </li>
    <li>
    The upcoming of tech companies and their need for technically versed staff
    </li>
</ul>

## The dot com crash

After a boom a crash will follow...

</figure>

The dot com crash was one of the most devastating setbacks for software development.

It was caused by high speculation and the growing discrepancy between the investments in tech and the low ROI (Return On Investment) on them.

Many startups failed during that time.

Unemployment spiked because of mass layoffs and the job market became highly competetive as new roles disappeared due to companies scaling back or canceling online projects.

The market had not only lost roles but the now unemployed software developers were faced with an oversaturated market where a job in the field was nearly impossible to get.
