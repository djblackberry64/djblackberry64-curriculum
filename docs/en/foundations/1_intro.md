      What are different concepts in Programming?
      <br />
      Why are they relevant?
      <br />
      How are they executed in different programming languages?
      <br />

      Examples include: Capsulation, Modularity, Readablity, Standartization, etc.
      </details>
      <details>
      <summary>How do I program?</summary>
      There is a bit of a setup required if you want to programm. Don't worry we will explain everything step by step.
        <ul>
          <details>
          <summary>OS</summary>
          An Operating System(OS) is a programm that runs on your hardware.</br>It's where you interact with your device.</br>This includes a file manager, oftentimes pre-installed software as well as other functionality necessary for the OS to run properly on your device.
          <ul>
          <details>
          <summary>Windows</summary>
          Windows is an OS developed by Microsoft.
          </details>
          <details>
          <summary>MacOS</summary>
          MacOS is an OS developed by Apple and Unix based.
          </details>
          <details>
          <summary>Linux</summary>
          Linux is an umbrella term for a list of OS all Unix based and build on top of the Linux Kernel.
          </details>
          <details>
          <summary>Other</summary>
          OSs either for mobile devices or based on other platforms like BSD.</br>These OSs are not so interesting for us as they're not normally used for software development.</br>We will explore them because some types of software development require releasing software for these operating systems and not just the ones we're using to develop.
          </details>
          </ul>
          </details>
          <details>
          <summary>IDE</summary>
          An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a program which is used to develop software.</br>It often includes special development tools for writing and debugging(correcting mistakes in a programm, more on that later) code.</br>
          Popular examples include VSCode, Zed and JetBrains IDEs.
          </details>
          <details>
          <summary>Installations</summary>
          You'll often have to install things to execute the code that you write.</br> Don't worry we will go through this process step by step.
